**Abstract:** The human parasitic fluke, _Schistosoma haematobium_ hybridizes with the livestock parasite _S. bovis_ in the laboratory, but the extent of hybridization in nature is unclear. We analyzed 34.6 million single nucleotide variants in 167 _S. bovis_ and _S. haematobium_ from 18 African countries, revealing a sharp genetic discontinuity between northern and southern _S. haematobium_. There was no evidence for recent hybridization between _S. bovis_ and _S. haematobium_ but introgression occurred 257-879 generations ago in northern populations. Fifteen introgressed _S. bovis_ genes are approaching fixation in northern _S. haematobium,_ and 4 genes maybe driving adaptation. The _S. bovis_-like mitochondria in northern _S. haematobium_ form two separate clades providing further evidence that introgression is rare and ancient. The lack of evidence for recent hybridization between _S. haematobium_ and _S. bovis_ and strong barriers to interspecific gene flow suggest that limited benefits will result from linking interventions against these human and livestock pathogens.
